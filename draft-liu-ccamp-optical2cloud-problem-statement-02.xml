<t>Many applications, including optical leased line, cloud VR and computing cloud, benefit from the network
   scenario where the data traffic to cloud data centers (DCs) is carried over optical network end to end.
   This document describes the problem statement and requirements, and presents a gap analysis on existing
   control plane protocols for supporting this network scenario.</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Cloud applications are becoming more popular and widely
   deployed in enterprises and vertical industries.  Organizations with
   multiple campuses are interconnected together with the remote cloud
   for storage and computing.  Such cloud services demands the underlying
   network to provide high quality experiences, such as high availability, 
   low latency, on-demand bandwidth adjustments, and so on.</t>

<t>Cloud services have been carried over IP/Ethernet-based aggregated networks for years. MPLS-based
   VPNs with traffic engineering (TE) are usually used to achieve desired service quality. 
   Provisioning and management of MPLS VPNs is known to be complicated and typically involves manual
   TE configurations across the network.</t>

<t>To improve the performance and flexibility of the aggregated networks, OTN (Optical Transport Network)
   networks are introduced to complement the IP/Ethernet-based aggregation networks to enable full-fiber
   connections. This scenario is described in the Fifth Generation Fixed Network Architecture 
   by the ETSI F5G ISG []. OTN can be used to provide high quality carrier services in addition to
   the traditional MPLS VPN services. OTN provides TDM-based connections with no queueing or scheduling
   needed, with an access bandwidth granularity of 1.25Gbps, i.e. ODU0 (Optical Data Unit) and above.
   This bandwidth granularity is typically more than what a single application would demand. 
   Therefore, user traffic usually needs to be aggregated before being carried forward through the network. However,
   advanced OTN techonologies developed in ITU-T work items have aimed to enhance OTN to support even smaller granular services
   with the introduction of the Optical Service Unit (OSU). 
   This enhancement makes OTN an even more suitable solution for bearing cloud traffic with high quality and bandwidth granularity close
   to what an IP/Ethernet-based network could offer.</t>

<t>Many cloud-based services that require high bandwdith, deterministic service quality and flexible access could potentially
   benefit from the network scenario of using OTN-based aggregation networks to interconnect cloud DCs. For example, intra-city Data Center Interconnects (DCIs), which communicate with each other to supports public and/or private cloud services, can use OTN for via intra-city DCI networks to ensure ultra-low latency and on-demand provisioning of large bandwidth connections for its Virtual Machine (VM) migration services. Another example is the high quality private line, which can be provided over OTN dedicated connections with high security and reliability for large enterprises such asfinancial, medical centers and education customers. Yet another example is the Cloud Virtual Reality (VR) services, which typcially requires high bandwidth (e.g. over 1Gbps for 4K or 8k VR) links with low latency (e.g. 10ms or less) and low jitter (e.g. 5ms or less) for rendering with satisfactory user experience. These network properties required for cloud VR services can be typically offered by OTN networks in high quality comparing with IP/Ethernet based networks.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement"/> and
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-gap-analysis"/> present a detailed analysis on
   the coordination requirements between IP-based networks and cloud DCs. This document complements the analysis by further
   examining the requirements and gaps when accessing cloud DCs through OTN networks, from the control plane perspective.
   Data plane requirements are out of the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Cloud services are deployed in geographically distributed means for scalability and resilliency 
   considerations, and they are usually hosted by multiple interconnected data
   centers (DCs). DCs are traditionally interconnected through Layer 2/3 switches or routers
   with full mesh connectivity. To improve interaction
   efficiency as well as service experience, OTN is also evaluated as an
   option to be used for DC interconnection. This network scenario is illustrated in 
   <xref target="fig-cloud-access-optical"/>.</t>

<t>A customer application is connected to the cloud via one of the Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE), and access cloud services that are typically hosted in multiple clouds
   attached to different cloud gateways. L2VPN or L3VPN are used as overlay services
   on OTN network to support multi-cloud access. Serving as an overlay, the OTN networks should
   provide the capability of creating different types of connections, including 
   point-to-point(P2P), point-to-multipoint(P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) connections to support
   diverse L2VPN or L3VPN services.</t>

<t>OTN connections were point-to-point by nature on the data plane. To support P2MP and MP2MP services, multiple 
   P2P OTN connections can be established between each source and destination pair. The routing and signaling protocols for OTN need to coordinate these OTN connections to ensure they are routed with proper diverse paths to meet resilliency and path quality constraints.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4461"/> defines the requirements for establishing P2MP MPLS label switched paths (LSPs). <xref target="RFC6388"/> describes
   extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for the setup of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs in MPLS Networks. The generic
   rules introduced by these work also apply to OTN networks, however, proper protocol extensions are missing and required for establishing P2MP and MP2MP connetctions with OTN resources, i.e. time slots.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="service-awareness" title="Service-awareness">

<t>Cloud-oriented services are dynamic in nature with frequent changes in bandwidth and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. However, in typical OTN network scenarios, OTN connections are typically preconfigured between provider edge (PE) nodes, and client traffic like IP or Ethernet are fixed mapped onto the payload of OTN frames at the ingress PE node. This makes the OTN connections rather static and cannot accommodate the dynamicity of the traffic, resulting in slow and inefficient use of the OTN bandwidth resources. To address this issue to make the OTN network more suitable for carrying cloud-oriented services, it needs to be able to understand the type of traffic and their QoS requirements, so that OTN connections can be dynamically built and selected with the best feasible paths. The mapping of client services to OTN connections should also be dynamically configured or modified to better adapt to the traffic changes.</t>

<t>New service-aware capabilties are needed for both the control plane and data plane to address this challenge for OTN networks. On the data plane, new hardware that can examine cloud traffic contents such as the IP header (destination IP address and/or the TOS field), VRF ids or layer 2 VLAN ids are introduced to make the PE node capable of sensing the type of traffic. This work for data plane are out of the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Upon examinining the cloud traffic contents and obtain client inforamtion such as cloud destination and QoS requirements, the PE node needs to forward such information to the control entity of the OTN network to make decisions on connection configurations. The client information could include but not limited to, destination IP addresses, type of cloud service, and QoS information such as bandwidth, latency bound and resiliency factors.The control entity may be an SDN controller or a control plane instance; in the former case communications are established between each of the PE nodes and the controller and the controller serves as a central authority for OTN connection configurations; whereas in the latter all of the PE nodes need to disseimate client information between each other using control plane protocols or possibly through some intermediate reflectors. It is desirable that the protocols used for both cases are consistent, and ideally, the same. A candidate protocol is the PCEP <xref target="RFC5440"/> protocol defined in the PCE working group, but there is currently no extensions defined for describing such client traffic information. Extensions to the PCEP protocol can be defined outside this document to support the use case. It is also possible to use the BGP Link State (BGP-LS) protocol <xref target="RFC7752"/> to perform the distribution of client information. However typically an OTN PE node does not run BGP protocols due to its heavy weight and complexity. Therefore, PCEP seems to be a better protocol choice in this case.</t>

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document describes the network-related problems enterprises
   face today when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic
   workloads in third-party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can
   be many problems associated with connecting to or among Clouds; the
   Net2Cloud problem statements are mainly for enterprises who already
   have traditional MPLS services and are interested in leveraging
   those networks (instead of completely abandoning them). This
   document aims to describe the problems of continuing using the MPLS
   networks when connecting workloads in the Cloud, and to clarify
   additional work in the IETF Routing area. Other problems are out of
   the scope of this document.

   Current operational problems are examined to determine whether there
   is a need to improve existing protocols or whether a new protocol is
   necessary to solve them.
