<t>Optical networking technologies such as fine-grain OTN (fgOTN) enable premium cloud-based services,
   including optical leased line, cloud Virtual Reality (cloud-VR), and computing to be carried end-to-end 
   optically between applications and cloud data centers (DCs), offering premium quality and deterministic
   performance.</t>

<t>This document describes the problem statement and requirements for accessing cloud services through optical 
   networks. It also discusses technical gaps for IETF-developed management and control protocols to support 
   service provisioning and management in such an all-optical network scenario.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Cloud applications are becoming more popular and widely
   deployed in enterprises and vertical industries.  Organizations with
   multiple campuses are interconnected together with the remote cloud
   for storage and computing.  Such cloud services demand that the underlying
   network provides high quality of experience, such as high availability,
   low latency, on-demand bandwidth adjustments, and so on.</t>

<t>Cloud services have been carried over IP/Ethernet-based aggregated networks for years.  MPLS-based
   VPNs with traffic engineering (TE) are usually used to achieve desired service quality.
   Provisioning and management of MPLS VPNs is known to be complicated and typically involves manual
   TE configuration across the network.</t>

<t>To improve the performance and flexibility of aggregated networks, Optical Transport Network (OTN)
   technology is introduced to complement the IP/Ethernet-based aggregation networks to enable full-fiber
   connections.  This scenario is described in the Fifth Generation Fixed Network Architecture
   by the ETSI F5G ISG <xref target="ETSI.GR.F5G.001"/>.  OTN can be used to provide high quality carrier services in addition to
   the traditional MPLS VPN services.  OTN provides Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) based connections
   with no queueing or scheduling needed, with an access bandwidth granularity of 1.25Gbps, i.e.,
   ODU0 (Optical Data Unit 0) and above.  This bandwidth granularity is typically more than what a
   single application would demand, therefore, user traffic usually needs to be aggregated before
   being carried forward through the network.  However, advanced OTN technologies developed in ITU-T
   work items have aimed to enhance OTN to support services of much finer granularity.  These enhancements are
   reflected in the latest transmission standards of fine-grain OTN, or fgOTN, development by the
   ITU-T Q11/SG15 <xref target="ITU-T.G.709.20-DRAFT"/>. fgOTN enables an even more suitable solution to bear cloud traffic with high quality
   and finer bandwidth granularity up to 10Mbps per time slot, which is very close to what an
   IP/Ethernet-based network could offer.</t>

<t>Many cloud-based services that require high bandwdith, deterministic service quality, and flexible
   access could potentially benefit from the network scenario of using OTN-based aggregation networks
   to interconnect cloud data centers (DCs).  For example, intra-city Data Center Interconnects (DCIs), which
   communicate with each other to supports public and/or private cloud services, can use OTN for via
   intra-city DCI networks to ensure ultra-low latency and on-demand provisioning of large bandwidth
   connections for their Virtual Machine (VM) migration services.  Another example is the high quality
   private line, which can be provided over OTN dedicated connections with high security and
   reliability for large enterprises such as financial, medical centers, and education customers.  Yet
   another example is the Cloud Virtual Reality (VR) services, which typcially require high bandwidth
   (e.g., over 1Gbps for 4K or 8k VR) links with low latency (e.g., 10ms or less) and low jitter (e.g.,
   5ms or less) for rendering with satisfactory user experience.  These network properties required
   for cloud VR services can typically be offered by OTNs with higher quality comparing to
   IP/Ethernet based networks.</t>

<t><xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement"/> and
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-gap-analysis"/> present a detailed analysis of
   the coordination requirements between IP-based networks and cloud DCs.  This document complements
   that analysis by further examining the requirements and gaps from the control plane perspective when
   accessing cloud DCs through OTNs.  Data plane requirements are out of the scope of this
   document.</t>

<section anchor="multi-cloud-access"><name>Multi-cloud Access</name>

<t>Cloud services are typically deployed in geographically distributed locations for scalability and resilliency,
   and hosted by multiple DCs, each of which provides different cloud applications. This requires a 
   Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) or Multi-Point-to-Multi-Point (MP2MP) connectivity between service access
   points and the cloud DCs. The connectivities are traditionally provided over Layer 2/3 connections. To improve interaction
   efficiency as well as service experience, OTN (including fgOTN) is also considered as a viable 
   option for DC interconnection. This network scenario is illustrated in the example scenario 
   <xref target="fig-cloud-access-optical"/>.</t>

<t>In this example, a customer application is connected to the cloud via one of the Customer Premises
   Equipment (CPE), and cloud services are hosted in multiple clouds that are
   attached to different cloud gateways.  Layer 2 or Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks
   (L2VPN or L3VPN) are used as overlay services on top of the OTN to support
   multi-cloud access.  Serving as an overlay, the OTNs should provide the
   capability to create different types of connections, including point-to-point (P2P),
   point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) connections to support
   diverse L2VPN or L3VPN services.</t>

<t>In the data plane, OTN connections are P2P by nature.  To support P2MP and MP2MP services,
   multiple P2P OTN connections can be established between each source and destination pair.
   The routing and signaling protocols for OTN need to coordinate these OTN connections to
   ensure they are routed with proper diverse paths to meet resilliency and path quality
   constraints.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4461"/> defines the requirements for establishing P2MP MPLS traffic engineering label
   switched paths (LSPs).  <xref target="RFC6388"/> describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP) for the setup of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs in MPLS Networks.  The generic rules introduced
   by those documents work also apply to OTNs, however, the protocol extensions are
   missing and are required for establishing P2MP and MP2MP connetctions with OTN resources,
   i.e., time slots.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="service-awareness"><name>Service Awareness</name>

<t>Cloud-oriented services are dynamic in nature with frequent changes in bandwidth and quality
   of service (QoS) requirements.  However, in typical OTN scenarios, OTN connections are
   preconfigured between provider edge (PE) nodes, and client traffic like IP or Ethernet is
   fixed-mapped onto the payload of OTN frames at the ingress PE node.  This makes the OTN
   connections rather static and they cannot accommodate the dynamicity of the traffic unless
   they are permanently over-provisioned, resulting in slow and inefficient use of the OTN
   bandwidth resources.  To address this issue and to make the OTN more suitable for carrying
   cloud-oriented services, it needs to be able to understand the type of traffic and its QoS
   requirements, so that OTN connections can be dynamically built and selected with the best
   feasible paths.  The mapping of client services to OTN connections should also be dynamically
   configured or modified to better adapt to the traffic changes.</t>

<t>New service-aware capabilties are needed for both the control plane and data plane to address
   this challenge for OTNs.  In the data plane, new hardware that can examine cloud traffic
   packet header fields (such as the IP header source and destination IP address and/or the type of service
   (TOS) field, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) identifiers, layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC)
   address or virtual local area network (VLAN) identifiers) are introduced to make the PE node
   able to sense the type of traffic.  This work for the data plane is out of the scope of this document.</t>

<t>Being service aware allows the OTN network to accurately identify the characteristics of carried
   client service flows and the real-time traffic of each flow, making it possible to achieve automated and 
   real-time operations such as dynamic connection establishment and dynamic bandwidth adjustment according 
   to preset policies. Those capabilities help to optimize the resource utilization and significantly
   reduce the operational cost of the network.</t>

<t>Upon examining the client traffic header fields and obtaining client information such as the
   cloud destination and QoS requirements, the OTN PE node needs to forward such information to the
   control entity of the OTN to make decisions on connection configurations, and map the client packets
   of different destination/QoS to different ODU connections The client information could include, 
   but is not limited to, the destination IP addresses, type of cloud
   service, and QoS information such as bandwidth, latency bounds, and resiliency factors.  The
   control entity may be an SDN controller or a control plane instace: in the former case
   communications are established between each of the PE nodes and the controller, and the
   controller serves as a central authority for OTN connection configurations; whereas in the
   latter case, all of the PE nodes need to disseimate client information to each other using
   control plane protocols or possibly through some intermediate reflectors.  It is desirable
   that the protocols used for both cases are consistent, and ideally, the same.  A candidate
   protocol is the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) <xref target="RFC5440"/>, but there are currently no
   extensions defined for describing such client traffic information.  Extensions to PCEP could
   be defined outside this document to support the use case.  It is also possible to use the BGP
   Link State (BGP-LS) protocol <xref target="RFC7752"/> to perform the distribution of client information.
   However, an OTN PE node does not typically run BGP protocols due to that BGP lacks protocol
   extensions to support optical networks. Therefore, PCEP seems to be a better protocol choice
   in this case.</t>

<section anchor="framework"><name>Framework</name>

<section anchor="service-identification-and-mapping"><name>Service Identification and Mapping</name>

<t>The OTN PE node should support the learning and identification of the packet header carried 
   by client services. The identification content may include but not limited to the following
   content:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Source and destination MAC addresses</t>
  <t>Source and destination IP addresses</t>
  <t>VRF identifier</t>
  <t>VLAN (S-VLAN and/or C-VLAN) identifier</t>
  <t>MPLS label</t>
</list></t>

<t>The OTN PE node should support reporting the above identified client services to the management
   and control system, which can obtain the client-side addresses reported by each node in the entire
   network to build up a global topology. Some of the learnt content, such as the VLAN identifier,
   are not required to be reported since VLAN is of only local significance.</t>

<t>The management and control system should be able to calculate the corresponding ODU connection route
   based on the source and destination addresses of the service, and create the mapping between service
   address and the ODU cnnection according to preset policies. The mapping table can be generated
   through management plane configuration or control plane protocol.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="reporting-service-identification"><name>Reporting Service Identification</name>

<t>The control plane protocol extension should report to the controller service identification contents, which
   should include at least the following content:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A private network or network slice identifier, which is a globally unique identifier to identify different
   tenants or applications supported by the private network</t>
  <t>OTN node identifier, which identify the OTN PE node that reported this packet</t>
  <t>The IP/MAC address of the client side learned by the OTN PE node</t>
</list></t>

<t>When the PCEP protocol is used, this extension may be defined as a PCEP Report message.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="configuring-service-mapping"><name>Configuring Service Mapping</name>

<t>The control plane protocol extension may be defined to push the mapping table between service address to 
   ODU connections from the controller to the OTN PE nodes. The message should include at least the following
   content:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A private network or network slice identifier, which is a globally unique identifier to identify different
   tenants or applications supported by the private network</t>
  <t>A mapping table of {service address, ODU connection identifier}, with each entry of the table contains
   at least the information of {remote OTN node, remote service address}, where the concept of "remote" is
   based on the perspective of the OTN device that receives this packet</t>
</list></t>

<t>When the PCEP protocol is used, this extension may be defined as a PCEP Update message.</t>

<t>This document analyzes the requirements and gaps in connecting to cloud DCs over optical networks
   without defining new protocols or interfaces. Therefore, this document introduces no new security

   plane are described in <xref target="RFC4203"/> and <xref target="RFC4328"/>, and risks presented by existing northbound and
   southbound control interfaces in general are described in <xref target="RFC8453"/>. Moreover, the data communication
   network (DCN) for OTN control plane protocols are encapsulated in fibers, which providers a much
   better security environment for running the protocols.</t>

      <t>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document describes a set of network-related problems
   enterprises face at the time of writing this document (2025) when
   interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in
   third-party data centers (DCs) (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). These problems
   are mainly from enterprises with conventional VPN services that want
   to leverage those networks (instead of altogether abandoning them).
   This document also describes various mitigation practices and
   actions to soften the issues induced by these problems.
