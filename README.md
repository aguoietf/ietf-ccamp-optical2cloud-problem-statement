# Problem Statement and Gap Analyis for Connecting to Cloud DCs via Optical Networks
# ietf-ccamp-optical2cloud-problem-statement

## Scope

This repository is to facilitate the work on the [IETF CCAMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ccamp/documents/) Individual Internet-Draft,
"[Problem Statement and Gap Analyis for Connecting to Cloud DCs via Optical Networks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-liu-ccamp-optical2cloud-problem-statement/)".

## Abstract

Many applications, including optical leased line, cloud VR and computing cloud, benefit from the network scenario where the data traffic to cloud data centers (DCs) is carried over optical network end to end.  This document describes the problem statement and requirements, and presents a gap analysis on existing control plane protocols for supporting this network scenario.
