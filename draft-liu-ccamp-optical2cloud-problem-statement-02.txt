Abstract

   Many applications, including optical leased line, cloud VR and
   computing cloud, benefit from the network scenario where the data
   traffic to cloud data centers (DCs) is carried over optical network
   end to end.  This document describes the problem statement and
   requirements, and presents a gap analysis on existing control plane
   protocols for supporting this network scenario.

1.  Introduction

   Cloud applications are becoming more popular and widely deployed in
   enterprises and vertical industries.  Organizations with multiple
   campuses are interconnected together with the remote cloud for
   storage and computing.  Such cloud services demands the underlying
   network to provide high quality experiences, such as high
   availability, low latency, on-demand bandwidth adjustments, and so
   on.

   Cloud services have been carried over IP/Ethernet-based aggregated
   networks for years.  MPLS-based VPNs with traffic engineering (TE)
   are usually used to achieve desired service quality.  Provisioning
   and management of MPLS VPNs is known to be complicated and typically
   involves manual TE configurations across the network.

   To improve the performance and flexibility of the aggregated
   networks, OTN (Optical Transport Network) networks are introduced to
   complement the IP/Ethernet-based aggregation networks to enable full-
   fiber connections.  This scenario is described in the Fifth
   Generation Fixed Network Architecture by the ETSI F5G ISG [].  OTN

   can be used to provide high quality carrier services in addition to
   the traditional MPLS VPN services.  OTN provides TDM-based
   connections with no queueing or scheduling needed, with an access
   bandwidth granularity of 1.25Gbps, i.e. ODU0 (Optical Data Unit) and
   above.  This bandwidth granularity is typically more than what a
   single application would demand.  Therefore, user traffic usually
   needs to be aggregated before being carried forward through the
   network.  However, advanced OTN techonologies developed in ITU-T work
   items have aimed to enhance OTN to support services of small
   granularity as low as 2Mbps with the introduction of the Optical
   Service Unit (OSU).  This enhancement makes OTN an even more suitable
   solution for bearing cloud traffic with high quality and bandwidth
   granularity close to what an IP/Ethernet-based network could offer.

   Many cloud-based services that require high bandwdith, deterministic
   service quality and flexible access could potentially benefit from
   the network scenario of using OTN-based aggregation networks to
   interconnect cloud DCs.  For example, intra-city Data Center
   Interconnects (DCIs), which communicate with each other to supports
   public and/or private cloud services, can use OTN for via intra-city
   DCI networks to ensure ultra-low latency and on-demand provisioning
   of large bandwidth connections for its Virtual Machine (VM) migration
   services.  Another example is the high quality private line, which
   can be provided over OTN dedicated connections with high security and
   reliability for large enterprises such asfinancial, medical centers
   and education customers.  Yet another example is the Cloud Virtual
   Reality (VR) services, which typcially requires high bandwidth (e.g.
   over 1Gbps for 4K or 8k VR) links with low latency (e.g. 10ms or
   less) and low jitter (e.g. 5ms or less) for rendering with
   satisfactory user experience.  These network properties required for
   cloud VR services can be typically offered by OTN networks in high
   quality comparing with IP/Ethernet based networks.

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-gap-analysis] present a detailed analysis
   on the coordination requirements between IP-based networks and cloud
   DCs.  This document complements the analysis by further examining the
   requirements and gaps when accessing cloud DCs through OTN networks,
   from the control plane perspective.  Data plane requirements are out
   of the scope of this document.

2.  Requirements and Gap Analysis

2.1.  Multi-cloud Access

   Cloud services are deployed in geographically distributed means for
   scalability and resilliency considerations, and they are usually
   hosted by multiple interconnected data centers (DCs).  DCs are
   traditionally interconnected through Layer 2/3 switches or routers
   with full mesh connectivity.  To improve interaction efficiency as
   well as service experience, OTN is also evaluated as an option to be
   used for DC interconnection.  This network scenario is illustrated in
   Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Multi-cloud access through OTN Network

   A customer application is connected to the cloud via one of the
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), and access cloud services that are
   typically hosted in multiple clouds attached to different cloud
   gateways.  L2VPN or L3VPN are used as overlay services on OTN network
   to support multi-cloud access.  Serving as an overlay, the OTN
   networks should provide the capability of creating different types of
   connections, including point-to-point(P2P), point-to-multipoint(P2MP)
   and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) connections to support diverse
   L2VPN or L3VPN services.

   OTN connections are point to point by nature on the data plane.  To
   support P2MP and MP2MP services, multiple P2P OTN connections can be
   established between each source and destination pair.  The routing
   and signaling protocols for OTN need to coordinate these OTN
   connections to ensure they are routed with proper diverse paths to
   meet resilliency and path quality constraints.

   [RFC4461] defines the requirements for establishing P2MP MPLS label
   switched paths (LSPs).  [RFC6388] describes extensions to the Label
   Distribution Protocol (LDP) for the setup of P2MP and MP2MP LSPs in
   MPLS Networks.  The generic rules introduced by these work also apply



Liu, et al.             Expires 12 December 2022                [Page 4]

   to OTN networks, however, proper protocol extensions are missing and
   required for establishing P2MP and MP2MP connetctions with OTN
   resources, i.e. time slots.

2.2.  Service-awareness

   Cloud-oriented services are dynamic in nature with frequent changes
   in bandwidth and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.  However, in
   typical OTN network scenarios, OTN connections are typically
   preconfigured between provider edge (PE) nodes, and client traffic
   like IP or Ethernet are fixed mapped onto the payload of OTN frames
   at the ingress PE node.  This makes the OTN connections rather static
   and cannot accommodate the dynamicity of the traffic, resulting in
   slow and inefficient use of the OTN bandwidth resources.  To address
   this issue to make the OTN network more suitable for carrying cloud-
   oriented services, it needs to be able to understand the type of
   traffic and their QoS requirements, so that OTN connections can be
   dynamically built and selected with the best feasible paths.  The
   mapping of client services to OTN connections should also be
   dynamically configured or modified to better adapt to the traffic
   changes.

   New service-aware capabilties are needed for both the control plane
   and data plane to address this challenge for OTN networks.  On the
   data plane, new hardware that can examine cloud traffic contents such
   as the IP header (destination IP address and/or the TOS field), VRF
   ids or layer 2 VLAN ids are introduced to make the PE node capable of
   sensing the type of traffic.  This work for data plane are out of the
   scope of this document.

   Upon examinining the cloud traffic contents and obtain client
   inforamtion such as cloud destination and QoS requirements, the PE
   node needs to forward such information to the control entity of the
   OTN network to make decisions on connection configurations.  The
   client information could include but not limited to, destination IP
   addresses, type of cloud service, and QoS information such as
   bandwidth, latency bound and resiliency factors.The control entity
   may be an SDN controller or a control plane instace; in the former
   case communications are established between each of the PE nodes and
   the controller and the controller serves as a central authority for
   OTN connection configurations; whereas in the latter all of the PE
   nodes need to disseimate client information between each other using
   control plane protocols or possibly through some intermediate
   reflectors.  It is desirable that the protocols used for both cases
   are consistent, and ideally, the same.  A candidate protocol is the
   PCEP [RFC5440] protocol defined in the PCE working group, but there
   is currently no extensions defined for describing such client traffic
   information.  Extensions to the PCEP protocol can be defined outside



Liu, et al.             Expires 12 December 2022                [Page 5]

   this document to support the use case.  It is also possible to use
   the BGP Link State (BGP-LS) protocol [RFC7752] to perform the
   distribution of client information.  However typically an OTN PE node
   does not run BGP protocols due to its heavy weight and complexity.
   Therefore, PCEP seems to be a better protocol choice in this case.

2.3.  Deterministic performance

   Accessing cloud-based services requires deterministic performance
   from the underlay optical networks in order to achieve good user
   experience.  Connections built on optical networks need to be
   deterministic in many quality factors, such as end-to-end latency,
   delay jitter, bandwidth, and availaility supported by end-to-end
   protection and restoration.  This deterministic performance are hard
   to reach on shared resources but can be achieved relatively easier on
   TDM-based optical networks.

   Traditionally in an optical network, connections are pre-configured
   and the speed of dynamic restoration and reconfiguration of
   connections are in the order of several hundred milliseconds to
   several minutes.  The control and management plane of the optical
   network should be enhanced to significantly improve the speed of
   connection operations and be able to convey accurate estimate of the
   performance to the upper layer to achieve end-to-end deterministic
   performance.  Extensions to existing control plane and management
   interfaces are likely needed to support this capability.

2.4.  High-performance and high-reliability

   To support the above-mentioned applications some of the network
   properties are critical to promise the Quality of Services (QoS).
   For instance, high bandwidth (e.g. larger than 1 Gbps), low latency
   (e.g. no more than 10 ms) and low jitter (e.g. no more than 5 ms),
   are required for Cloud VR.  In addition, small-granularity container
   is required to improve the efficiency of the networks.

   It is also critical to support highly reliable DCI for cloud
   services.  With advanced optical transport network protection and
   automatic recovery technologies, services can still run properly even
   fiber cuts occur in the DCI network.  Specific protection and
   restoration schemes are required, to provide high reliability for the
   networks.
