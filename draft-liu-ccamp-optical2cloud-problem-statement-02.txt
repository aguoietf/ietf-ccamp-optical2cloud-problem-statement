                            Optical Networks
           draft-liu-ccamp-optical2cloud-problem-statement-02

Abstract

   Many applications, including optical leased line, cloud VR and
   computing cloud, benefit from the network scenario where the data
   traffic to cloud data centers (DCs) is carried end-to-end over an
   optical network.  This document describes the problem statement and
   requirements for connecting to cloud DCs over optical networks, and
   presents a gap analysis for existing control plane protocols for
   supporting this network scenario.

1.  Introduction

   Cloud applications are becoming more popular and widely deployed in
   enterprises and vertical industries.  Organizations with multiple
   campuses are interconnected together with the remote cloud for
   storage and computing.  Such cloud services demand that the
   underlying network provides high quality of experience, such as high
   availability, low latency, on-demand bandwidth adjustments, and so
   on.

   Cloud services have been carried over IP/Ethernet-based aggregated
   networks for years.  MPLS-based VPNs with traffic engineering (TE)
   are usually used to achieve desired service quality.  Provisioning
   and management of MPLS VPNs is known to be complicated and typically
   involves manual TE configuration across the network.

   To improve the performance and flexibility of aggregated networks,
   Optical Transport Network (OTN) technology is introduced to
   complement the IP/Ethernet-based aggregation networks to enable full-
   fiber connections.  This scenario is described in the Fifth
   Generation Fixed Network Architecture by the ETSI F5G ISG
   [ETSI.GR.F5G.001].  OTN can be used to provide high quality carrier
   services in addition to the traditional MPLS VPN services.  OTN
   provides Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) based connections with no

   queueing or scheduling needed, with an access bandwidth granularity
   of 1.25Gbps, i.e., ODU0 (Optical Data Unit 0) and above.  This
   bandwidth granularity is typically more than what a single
   application would demand, therefore, user traffic usually needs to be
   aggregated before being carried forward through the network.
   However, advanced OTN technologies developed in ITU-T work items have
   aimed to enhance OTN to support services of smaller granularity with
   the introduction of the Optical Service Unit (OSU)
   [ITU-T.SG15.Q11_15.WI.G.osu].  These enhancements make OTN an even
   more suitable solution for bearing cloud traffic with high quality
   and bandwidth granularity close to what an IP/Ethernet-based network
   could offer.

   Many cloud-based services that require high bandwdith, deterministic
   service quality, and flexible access could potentially benefit from
   the network scenario of using OTN-based aggregation networks to
   interconnect cloud data centers (DCs).  For example, intra-city Data
   Center Interconnects (DCIs), which communicate with each other to
   supports public and/or private cloud services, can use OTN for via
   intra-city DCI networks to ensure ultra-low latency and on-demand
   provisioning of large bandwidth connections for their Virtual Machine
   (VM) migration services.  Another example is the high quality private
   line, which can be provided over OTN dedicated connections with high
   security and reliability for large enterprises such as financial,
   medical centers, and education customers.  Yet another example is the
   Cloud Virtual Reality (VR) services, which typcially require high
   bandwidth (e.g., over 1Gbps for 4K or 8k VR) links with low latency
   (e.g., 10ms or less) and low jitter (e.g., 5ms or less) for rendering
   with satisfactory user experience.  These network properties required
   for cloud VR services can typically be offered by OTNs with higher
   quality comparing to IP/Ethernet based networks.

   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-problem-statement] and
   [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-net2cloud-gap-analysis] present a detailed analysis
   of the coordination requirements between IP-based networks and cloud
   DCs.  This document complements that analysis by further examining
   the requirements and gaps from the control plane perspective when
   accessing cloud DCs through OTNs.  Data plane requirements are out of
   the scope of this document.

2.1.  Multi-cloud Access

   Cloud services are deployed in geographically distributed locations
   for scalability and resilliency, and they are usually hosted by
   multiple interconnected DCs.  DCs have usually been interconnected
   through Layer 2/3 switches or routers with full mesh connectivity.
   To improve interaction efficiency as well as service experience, OTN
   is also considered as an option for DC interconnection.  This network
   scenario is illustrated in Figure 1.

              Figure 1: Multi-cloud access through an OTN

   A customer application is connected to the cloud via one of the
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), and access cloud services are
   hosted in multiple clouds that are attached to different cloud
   gateways.  Layer 2 or Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN or
   L3VPN) are used as overlay services on top of the OTN to support
   multi-cloud access.  Serving as an overlay, the OTNs should provide
   the capability to create different types of connections, including
   point-to-point (P2P), point-to-multipoint (P2MP) and multipoint-to-
   multipoint (MP2MP) connections to support diverse L2VPN or L3VPN
   services.

   In the data plane, OTN connections are P2P by nature.  To support
   P2MP and MP2MP services, multiple P2P OTN connections can be
   established between each source and destination pair.  The routing
   and signaling protocols for OTN need to coordinate these OTN
   connections to ensure they are routed with proper diverse paths to
   meet resilliency and path quality constraints.

Internet-Draft       Cloud Optical Problem Statement           June 2022


   [RFC4461] defines the requirements for establishing P2MP MPLS traffic
   engineering label switched paths (LSPs).  [RFC6388] describes
   extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for the setup of
   P2MP and MP2MP LSPs in MPLS Networks.  The generic rules introduced
   by those documents work also apply to OTNs, however, the protocol
   extensions are missing and are required for establishing P2MP and
   MP2MP connetctions with OTN resources, i.e., time slots.

2.2.  Service-awareness

   Cloud-oriented services are dynamic in nature with frequent changes
   in bandwidth and quality of service (QoS) requirements.  However, in
   typical OTN scenarios, OTN connections are preconfigured between
   provider edge (PE) nodes, and client traffic like IP or Ethernet is
   fixed-mapped onto the payload of OTN frames at the ingress PE node.
   This makes the OTN connections rather static and they cannot
   accommodate the dynamicity of the traffic unless they are permanently
   over-provisioned, resulting in slow and inefficient use of the OTN
   bandwidth resources.  To address this issue and to make the OTN more
   suitable for carrying cloud-oriented services, it needs to be able to
   understand the type of traffic and its QoS requirements, so that OTN
   connections can be dynamically built and selected with the best
   feasible paths.  The mapping of client services to OTN connections
   should also be dynamically configured or modified to better adapt to
   the traffic changes.

   New service-aware capabilties are needed for both the control plane
   and data plane to address this challenge for OTNs.  In the data
   plane, new hardware that can examine cloud traffic packet header
   fields (such as the IP header destination IP address and/or the type
   of service (TOS) field, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)
   identifiers, or layer 2 virtual laocal area network (VLAN)
   identifiers) are introduced to make the PE node able to sense the
   type of traffic.  This work for the data plane is out of the scope of
   this document.

   Upon examinining the cloud traffic header fields and obtaining client
   inforamtion such as the cloud destination and QoS requirements, the
   PE node needs to forward such information to the control entity of
   the OTN to make decisions on connection configurations.  The client
   information could include, but is not limited to, the destination IP
   addresses, type of cloud service, and QoS information such as
   bandwidth, latency bounds, and resiliency factors.  The control
   entity may be an SDN controller or a control plane instace: in the
   former case communications are established between each of the PE
   nodes and the controller, and the controller serves as a central
   authority for OTN connection configurations; whereas in the latter
   case, all of the PE nodes need to disseimate client information to

   each other using control plane protocols or possibly through some
   intermediate reflectors.  It is desirable that the protocols used for
   both cases are consistent, and ideally, the same.  A candidate
   protocol is the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440], but
   there are currently no extensions defined for describing such client
   traffic information.  Extensions to PCEP could be defined outside
   this document to support the use case.  It is also possible to use
   the BGP Link State (BGP-LS) protocol [RFC7752] to perform the
   distribution of client information.  However, an OTN PE node does not
   typically run BGP protocols due to that BGP lacks protocol extensions
   to support optical networks.  Therefore, PCEP seems to be a better
   protocol choice in this case.

3.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD

4.  Security Considerations

   This document analyzes the requirements and gaps in connecting to
   cloud DCs over optical networks without defining new protocols or
   interfaces.  Therefore, this document introduces no new security
   considerations to the control or management plane of OTN.  Risks
   presented by existing OTN control plane are described in [RFC4203]
   and [RFC4328], and risks presented by existing northbound and
   southbound control interfaces in general are described in [RFC8453].
   Moreover, the data communication network (DCN) for OTN control plane
   protocols are encapsulated in fibers, which providers a much better
   security environment for running the protocols.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
